## FAQ

### Will this client support themes/plugins?
Yes, but my first priority is to implement most of the stock client's features

### Is this against Discord TOS?
Unfortunately, it is. Although I'm pretty sure Discord won't start banning anyone 
for using OpenCord, considering how many mods of the stock clients already exist.
Even with that, use this client at your own risk.

### Working version wen?
Soonâ„¢
