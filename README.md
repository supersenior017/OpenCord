## Why does this exist?

Current Discord app sucks as it doesn't support any type of customization (themes, plugins, layout
etc...). The goal of this project is to reimagine the Discord experience on mobile devices.

## Status of OpenCord

- [ ] Full (or at least most essential) Discord feature implementation
- [ ] Theme support
- [ ] Plugin support
- [ ] Multiplatform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)

for more information see [STATUS.md](/STATUS.md)

## FAQ

### Will this client support themes/plugins?

Yes, but the first priority is to implement most of the stock client's features

### Is this against Discord TOS?

Yes, it is. However, there has been no instances of Discord banning people for just using modified
clients. What they do automatically ban for, is API abuse or strange requests. Therefore, OpenCord
takes great caution in emulating official clients exactly, but as it is still in development, please
use an alt account for your safety.
